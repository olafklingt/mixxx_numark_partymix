This is a complete rewrite of the Numark Party Mix Controller on the basis of [Numark Mixtrack Pro FX](https://github.com/mixxxdj/mixxx/blob/main/res/controllers/Numark%20Mixtrack%20Pro%20FX.midi.xml)


The mapping that matches the controller design most will be merged soon into mixxx. This repository is for variations that I find usefull.

# Installation

Put the .xml and the .js files in the user controller mapping folder or the system controller mapping folder of your Mixxx installation. More detailed information about where to place these files is available in the Mixxx documentation: [Controller Mapping File Locations](https://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/controller_mapping_file_locations)

# Variants

Numark-Party-Mix - original mapping (should be removed after merge in mixxx project)
